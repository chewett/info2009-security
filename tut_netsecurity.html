<h2>The increaseing thread to security</h2>

<p class="lead">
    Over the years, network attack tools and methods have evolved. For example, 20 years ago an attacker had to have sophisticated computer, programming, and networking knowledge in order to use fundamental tools and basic attacks. As time went on, and attackers' methods and tools improved, attackers did not required the same level of sophisticated knowledge anymore. As a result, the entry-level requirements for attackers were lowered. People who previously would not have participated in computer crime are now able to do so.

    As the types of threats, attacks, and exploits have evolved, various terms have been coined to describe the individuals involved. Some of the most common terms are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>White hat</b> - an individual who looks for vulnerabilities in systems or networks and then reports these vulnerabilities to the owners of the system so that they can be fixed. They are ethically opposed to the abuse of computer systems. A white hat generally focuses on securing IT systems, whereas a black hat (the opposite) would like to break into them.</li>
    <li><b>Hacker</b> - a general term that has historically been used to describe a computer programming expert. More recently, this term is often used in a negative way to describe an individual that attempts to gain unauthorized access to network resources with malicious intent. </li>
    <li><b>Black hat</b> - another term for individuals who use their knowledge of computer systems to break into systems or networks that they are not authorized to use, usually for personal or financial gain. A cracker is an example of a black hat.</li>
    <li><b>Cracker</b> - a more accurate term to describe someone who tries to gain unauthorized access to network resources with malicious intent. </li>
    <li><b>Phreaker</b> - an individual who manipulates the phone network to cause it to perform a function that is not allowed. A common goal of phreaking is breaking into the phone network, usually through a payphone, to make free long distance calls. </li>
    <li><b>Spammer</b> - an individual who sends large quantities of unsolicited e-mail messages. Spammers often use viruses to take control of home computers and use them to send out their bulk messages. </li>
    <li><b>Phisher</b> - uses e-mail or other means to trick others into providing sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or passwords. A phisher masquerades as a trusted party that would have a legitimate need for the sensitive information.</li>
</ul>
