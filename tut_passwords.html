<h2>Do you know how to make a secure password?</h2>

<p>Your password is the only thing between you and someone trying to hack into your account. For places like your bank account you should use a strong and different password from the ones you normally use. This means that if a third party service uses a bad system and gets hacked then you will not be at risk and they will only lose your weaker password.</p>

<p>
    A strong password:
    <ul>
        <li>Is longer than 10 characters e.g. thisisalongpassword</li>
        <li>Hard is guess but something personal so you remember e.g. iliketoplaycomputergameslikemario</li>
        <li>Has a mix of letters numbers and symbols, you could add a memorable number to the end of a good password and a random number of symbols e.g. passwordislong2011#####</li>

    </ul>
