<h2>Do i need to update my programs?</h2>

<p class="lead">Program updates are very important to keep secure. Normally updates will add in new features but more importantly it will add fixes to security flaws.</p>

<p>Your browser is one of the most important pieces of software to keep updated. There are normally security issues that could cause you to get a virus from just browsing the internet. Most current browsers will automatically update or tell you that there is an update and ask if you want to update. You should always update it if there is a new version.</p>

<p>There are also other programs that you use with the internet such as Adobe Flash and Adobe PDF Reader that can also be a attack point which also need to be updated</p>

<p>Since your browser is the main point of contact when using the internet we suggest checking that you are using the latest version.
