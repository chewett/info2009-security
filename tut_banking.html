<p class="lead">Banking online is normally safe and secure however you need to watch out for a few key features to ensure you are protected.</p>

<p>On the right image you can see a couple of security features that you should pay attention to:

<ul>
	<li>In the address bar, you should see a padlock, this may differ depending on your browser but if it is a secure website this should be there</li>
	<li>The website URL should begin with http<strong>s</strong>:// the extra S means that it is a secure website that will treat your details properly</li>
	<li>Many browsers, when you click on the padlock will display additional information. Here you can see that it is an official website that has been verified.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
When online banking you should also remember the following information

<ul>
	<li>Never click a link on your emails directing you to log into your bank. Always type in your bank URL</li>
	<li>If you bank sends you an email requesting personal details you should question if it is true. They will never ask for personal details and if needed phone them up to ask about it.</li>
</ul>
</p>
