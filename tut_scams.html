<h3>Example Spam Email</h3>

<p><a href="img/spam_email_big.jpg"><img class="media-object" src="img/spam_email_big.jpg"></a></p>

<p>This email shows typical signs of being an junk message. Examples here include:</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Email from someone you have never talked to</b> - Any email from anyone who you have not previously emailed is probably spam and should be treated with suspicion. If it doesn't look right delete it and do not reply. Replying will tell them you read their email and they will send you more spam.</li>
    <li><b>Asking you to download and run a file</b> - Here they ask you to look at the file and run it. This will most likely be a virus which will attempt to steal your details. You should never download any attachment from anyone without confirming what it is. Especially if you didn't ask for it. Even if it is from a friend you should look at the content of the email to decide if you should open it because their account might have been hacked.</li>
    <li><b>Asking for personal details</b> - No banking company will email you about your account and ask you to send your details. If any email asks for personal details then it is probably spam and should be deleted</li>
    <li><b>Asking you to pay a small fee</b> - Many scams operate by trying to extort small amounts of money from people. You should never pay someone money unless you are sure they are an official body who you do need to pay. You should never send money over the internet because an email tells you to.</li>
</ul>
