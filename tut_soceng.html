<h2>Social Engineering</h2>

<p class="lead">
    The easiest hack involves no computer skill at all. If an intruder can trick a member of an organisation into giving away valuable information, such as the location of files or passwords, then the process of hacking is made much easier. This type of attack is called social engineering, and it can include appeals to the ego of an employee, or it can be a disguised person or faked document that makes someone provide sensitive information.

<p>
    Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that involves using e-mail or other types of messages in an attempt to trick others into providing sensitive information, such as credit card numbers or passwords. The phisher masquerades as a trusted party that has a seemingly legitimate need for the sensitive information. 
</p>
<p>
    Frequently, phishing scams involve sending out spam e-mails that appear to be from known online banking or auction sites. These e-mails contain hyperlinks that appear to be legitimate, but actually take users to a fake website set up by the phisher to capture their information. The site appears to belong to the party that was faked in the e-mail. When the user enters the information, it is recorded for the phisher to use.

<p>
    Phishing attacks can be prevented by educating users and implementing reporting guidelines when they receive suspicious e-mail. Administrators can also block access to certain web sites and configure filters that block suspicious e-mail.
